When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  	A remote repository would allow you to collaborate with others.  It would be very difficult to share and keep version control over a local copy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository

	In general, the purpose of a repository is to share code.  You would want to manually pull changes so you can control the code baseline.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
	
	  Forks are Github clones of Github repositories.  Clones can be from Github to a local repository or local repository to local repository.  Branches are a completely different concept - they branch from a commit history so code can be changed without altering the code baseline.
